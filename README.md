# Face Detection for Digital Cameras

## Project Objective

The aim of this project is to develop a reliable facial identification system that, through the use of machine learning and computer vision techniques, can detect faces in an image and provide the coordinates of the bounding boxes surrounding them. This system is designed to operate efficiently even on hardware with limited computing capabilities, ensuring broad compatibility and accessibility.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Dataset Research and Selection
- Identify and select a suitable public facial recognition dataset for the project's purpose.
- Prepare the data for training, including any necessary cleaning, normalization, and bounding box annotation.

### 2. Data Exploration and Preparation
- Analyze the dataset to understand its characteristics and potential challenges.
- Implement the necessary pre-processing procedures to prepare the data for training.

### 3. Model Choice and Training
- Conduct literature research to identify the most suitable machine learning models that are also computationally inexpensive.
- Develop and train the model on the selected dataset, performing cross-validation to test its effectiveness.

### 4. Prediction Pipeline Implementation
- Create a scikit-learn pipeline that integrates data pre-processing, feature extraction, and model inference phases.
- Optimize the pipeline to maximize performance while keeping computational requirements low.
